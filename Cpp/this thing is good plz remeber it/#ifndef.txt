#ifndef MYCLASS_H
#define MYCLASS_H

class MyClass
{
  public:
  MyClass();
  protected:
  private:
};

#endif // MYCLASS_H 



the above code makes it so if a header file is included more than 
once the same class wont be defined multiple times within one file


ifndef stands for "if not defined". 
The first pair of statements tells the program to define the MyClass header file if it has not been defined already.
endif ends the condition.
