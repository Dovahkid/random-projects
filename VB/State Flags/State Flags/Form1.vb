It was expected that the Iowa men would fight in State regiments as they had in former wars and this emphasized the desirability of a State flag to designate the Iowa units. The organization most interested in this matter was the Iowa Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution which had already prepared two designs. On May 11, 1917, Mrs. Lue B. Prentiss, chairman of the Societys flag committee, Mrs. Dixie Gephardt, and a number of other interested persons appeared before the State Council on National Defense, presented a flag design submitted by Mrs. Gebhardt, and asked that it be adopted as the State flag for use by the Iowa soldiers. The Council approved the plan without much discussion. Thereupon the Daughters of the American Revolution had a number of flags manufactured and presented one to each of the Iowa National Guard regiments, one of which — as the 168th United States Infantry — was already in France. The use of state flags however, was soon rendered almost impossible by the policy adopted by the War Department of assigning men to military units without regard to the State from which they came. 1"

The state name OKLAHOMA was ammended to the 1925 design and is displayed in white letters below the shield. This change was not popular in some circles as it was felt that the design of the Oklahoma State Flag was significantly unique without this reminder."

This is the year that Oregon was admitted to the union.Depicted on the shield, is a blazing sun setting over the Pacific Ocean, mountains, forests and a Conestoga wagon all representing the natural resources and splendor of Oregon and the early settlers to the territory. A plow, a sheaf of wheat and a pickax represent the early industry of the state; agriculture and mining. Two ships are shown; a British Man-of-War and an American trade vessel. The departing British ship and arriving American ship are said to represent that claim to the land was laid by both Great Britain and The United States at the same time. It is also said that the tack of the two ships represents the ascendance of American power in the western hemisphere. Another interpretation has the departure and arrival as representative of trade or commerce. This explanation would seem to ignore that the British vessel is a Man-of-War.The crest of the shield is the American eagle. Also displayed is a banner with the words The Union. The eagle and the banner express support for The Union that Oregon joined in 1859.Oregon state flag reverseRemember that the Oregon State Flag is the only state flag with a different design on each side?With a nickname like The Beaver State one might easily guess what lies on the reverse side of the flag.

The banner that the protesters hoisted displayed three white crescents on a blue background. Ten years later in 1775, Colonel William Moultrie was asked by the South Carolina Revolutionary Council of Safety to design a banner for the use of South Carolina troops. Colonel Moultrie chose a simple and direct design that displayed a crescent on a blue field. The new flag was the same blue color of the soldier's uniforms and the crescent echoed the symbol that the soldiers wore on the front of their caps."

But, once the territory became a part of the United States, there seems to have been little doubt that a state flag would honor George Washington in some way.At the beginning of the 20th century, many towns and cities throughout the state informally adopted a military flag that displayed a gold profile of our first President on blue bunting. Other flags in use simply centered the state seal on a field of purple or green similar to the current design.When an official Washington State Flag was finally adopted on May 5, 1923, over thirty years after Washington became a state, the legislature described the flag as...of dark green silk or bunting and shall bear in its center a reproduction of the seal of the state of Washington...Originally, the law allowed that the flag to might be edged with either gold or green fringe. This was changed in 1925 to specify a gold or yellow color of the same shade as the seal.The specifications for the flag were amended in 2005 to reflect textile industry standards. Today's specification calls for Cable Color (Textile) Spanish Yellow 80068 or Pantone PMS DS-5-4 for both the state seal gold and the gold fringe, if any.The Washington State Flag is the only state flag with a green field and it's the only state flag that displays an image of an actual person.

After years of effort to distinguish the Wisconsin flag in some more noticable way, the enactment of Chapter 286, Laws of 1979 responded with the addition of the word WISCONSIN in white letters above the state coat of arms and the date that Wisconsin was admitted to the union, 1848 in white letters below the state coat of arms."

President Lincoln approved the statehood bill for West Virginia on January 1, 1863. On April 20, 1863, West Virginia was proclaimed a State, effective 60 days later on June 20, 1863.In the midst of the Civil War, turmoil was everywhere and it wasn't until September that West Virginia adopted its official State seal, its coat of arms the most prominent component of the State flag.Another prominent component of the State flag is West Virginia's State flower, big laurel (Rhododendron maximum), adopted in 1903.The following year, 1904, St. Louis, Missouri staged an exposition, The Louisiana Purchase Exposition, also know as the Saint Louis World's Fair.West Virginia needed to send a flag to the exposition to represent itself. A white flag with blue borders that featured the State flower on the obverse side (front) and the West Virginia coat of arms on the reverse side (back) was created. This flag was not an official representative of the State of West Virginia when it appeared at the exposition, but on February 24, 1905, the West Virginia Legislature made it so.Evidently, this design sparked some discontent and, two years later on February 25, 1907, changes were officially approved. The coat of arms was moved to the obverse side (front) of the flag and the big laurel was moved to the reverse side (back) of the flag. Additionally, a red ribbon, reading State of West Virginia was added below the coat of arms.Of course, it was found that producing a flag with a difference between the obverse side and the reverse side was not practical. It was expensive. To remedy the situation, big laurel, the coat of arms, and the red ribbon were combined to create a suitable display to appear on both sides of the flag.The West Virginia Legislature approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 18 on March 7, 1929. Resolution No. 18 described the West Virginia State flag the flies over the Capitol today."

Dr. Grace Raymond Hebard, Professor of Political Economy at the University of Wyoming, was at that time state regent for the Daugters of the American Revolution (DAR). She suggested to the DAR that a flag should be designed for the state.An open competition for the design of an official Wyoming state flag was announced. A prize of $20.00 was offered for the flag design that was found most appropriate by the DAR at their state conference in Sheridan to be held in the late summer.The competition, advertised throughout the state, was noticed by Wilbur Parke Keays and he suggested to his daughter Verna that she submit a design to the DAR. Verna had just graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago. She had studied Design And Decoration at the institute. Verna did not immediately jump to the task as a school friend from Ohio was visiting for the summer. But as summer began to wane, the deadline for submission approached and her father's suggestions became more insistant, Verna decided that she should get down to business.One night Verna awakened from a sound sleep and a complete and perfect design for the state flag came to her. In her excitement, she attempted to arouse her friend to share her vision. Her friend mumbled and rolled over and back to sleep. In the morning Verna recreated the design that had come to her in the night finding great pleasure in the inspirational ... Source of all Creation.Verna managed to complete her design and submit it for consideration. Several days after she submitted the design, Dr. Hebard called her from Sheridan to inform her that her design had been awarded first place from among the thirty-seven entries. Verna was invited to the conference to speak and accept her $20.00 prize.With the assistance of Dr. Hebard, details of the design were perfected, a technical description was written and a bill was drafted for presentation to the Fourteenth State Legislature.The state flag bill was introduced in the Senate by the Honorable W.W. Daley of Rawlins, Wyoming. Much humorous wrangling took place over whether the bison should be changed to a donkey, an elephant or a moose, representing the current political makeup of the state at that time. In the end, the bison remained and the bill was passed and the flag adopted on January 13, 1917. Governor Robert D. Carey signed the bill into law.In February of 1917, the State Legislature voted to have folders printed depicting the new state flag with a written description. These folders were distributed to every school child in the state of Wyoming.A bison, the Wyoming State mammal and often called the monarch of the plains, is centered on the flag. Branded on the bison is the Great Seal of Wyoming. In the original design approved by the State Legislature the bison is shown facing away from the staff. Verna had drawn the bison as facing away from the staff symbolizing the freedom with which the bison had once roamed over the Wyoming plains. Dr. Hebard had not agreed with this and suggested that better balance of design would be achieved if the bison faced the staff. This is the way that the first flags were manufactured and, though not official this is how the bison has been shown since 1917.The colors of the State Flag are the same as those of the National Flag. The red border represents the Indians who knew and loved the country long before the settlers came.; also the blood of the pioneers who gave their lives reclaiming the soil. White is the emblem of purity and uprightness over Wyoming. Blue, the color of the sky and mountains, is symbolic of fidelity, justice and virility."
